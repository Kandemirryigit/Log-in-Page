Final project looks like this.Classic log-in page project.Nearly every time we see this pages to sign-in any apllication,social media application or Website...İn my code you firstly answer with which one do you wanna log-in phone number or username after that you should answer username/Phone number and password questions.İf you write one of them wrong you can see which information you wrote wrong.I find this useful.İn daily life most log-in page we cant see which information we wrote wrong.But of course it is much more secure.I used https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Ogre&t= this website to create logos.I wanted to create a user interface in the terminal screen because of that ı commonly used print("\n"*50).İt creates a fresh screen.
